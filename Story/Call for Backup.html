<p style="color:white">You notice the head guard, and then he notices you. His attention snaps onto you. In a moment of panic, you thought that if you called for backup you can get passed this guard easily. So that's what you do. You call for backup, and some people immeidately come, as everyone knows that they are working together. You and the backup start staring down the head guard, and the head guard does the same. You and the backup were ready to go when you all got jumped by some other guards. Seeing this more backup decided to come, which means more guards came. Soon this became a battle between your clan and alliances and the guards of the sps. The battle was looking good, as you guys planned that something like this might have happened, and therefore you guys got weapons. At one point, there were gun shots. The guards were starting to use their guns against you, which was not good. You, your clan, and the alliances all started to run away. You all ran in weird patterns so then the guards will have a harder time hitting their shots. Some people dropped, but mostly everyone was fine. That was until you got shot in the foot. The guards took you away, but not without resistance. The whole clan knew that you were a key part of escaping the prison. So they tried to stop the guards, but to no avail. Everyone that tried to make the guards not take you away were also captured. You all got taken inside of the sps, which was the last time that you guys got to see each other. Then, you got your last meal.
