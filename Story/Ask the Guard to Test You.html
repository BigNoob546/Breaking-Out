<h1 style="font-family:arial;color:navy;font-size:20px;">Ask the Guard to Test You</h1>

<p style="color:white">You are in your cell, talking to the guard. You say that you have learned your lesson, and the guard doubts that, and requests you to prove it. You think of what to say, and just try to think up of a plan. Then, you confidently say "Okay then, test me." The guard get's shocked that you were able to say that to his face, but nonetheless he does test you. He asks you 5 different questions that are decently hard to answer, but you are able to answer them easily. The guard then asks you to explain why you did your crime, and to take an oath that you are not going to do any of this in the future. You go by these rules, and the guard not only let's you out of the prison, but also clears your criminal record! As you walk out of the prison, the guard tells you to wait, and gives you some money, a job recommendation, and an apartment that has cheap rent rates. You then walk out of the prison, this time swearing that you are never going to break the law again.
