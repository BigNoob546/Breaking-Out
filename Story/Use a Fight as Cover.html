<h1 style="font-family:arial;color:navy;font-size:20px;">Escape Through the Front Door, Using a Fight as Cover</h1>

<p style="color:white">You start looking around for ways that you can get out of this prison. You look at all the ways that you can escape. Finally, after a bit of thinking from your big brain, you decide that escaping from the front door is the best way to go, as the ohter ways can have some major flaws. The prisoners mgiht have made a fake exit, the fence might be an electric fence, and trying to get a military vehicle is just way too hard. So, you told everyone that they are going to have to find a way to sneak past the fight, and then just open the door and get out. You then command everyone to scatter. You, each member of your clan, and each member of your allies, all go in different directions, staying away from each other to make it look like they are all going by themselves. You start thinking about when the right time was. After a bit of thinking, you decide that to know the best tie, you need to carefully observe, then when your gut tells you to go, you go. So you find a place where you are unlikely to be found, and you start ovserving. While observing, you see some of your clan and allies escape, while others don't. Then, you get the feeling in your gut that you need to go. So you start. While trying to do the operation swiftly, you are also trying to improv a way out. You think that the best way is to just walk around the area, to make you not suspicious. Then, when the people in the fight can't see you, you bolt thorugh the door. "Yes, this is a good plan", you thought to yourself. You start walking around the area, and trying to make you less suspicious. Then, the time that you were waing for comes. The fight goes away from the door, and they are in a possition where they won't be able to notice you. You start running to the door when, out of no where, you get knocked out by a punch that you didn't even see! You immediately drop to the ground, and you can't remember what had happened. When you regain consciousness, you see a horrible sight. There are people dead everywhere after all the fighting and arguing. Most importantly though, most of your clan and allies are dead. You aren't sure how, but they are dead. You see the bodies of the people that helped you try and escape out of the prison that you hated so much. Then, you feel yourself fading.
