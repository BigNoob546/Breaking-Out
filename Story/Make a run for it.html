<p style="color:white">You see the head guard and he snaps his attention onto you. You know that if he catches you, you're in big trouble. So, you try and make a run for it. The head guard get startled a bit, but then almost immediately shoots your foot so you can't run. He then get's some guards to bring you in, while he persues others that are trying to escape as well. You are dragged back into the prison, this time in a cell that is way harder to break out of. You don't know how much time goes by, but at one point you are let out of the cell, but not the prison. You go to a place where people are talking, and you hear about the Break Out. You heard that some of your clan and alliances made it out, but most of them were caught, and the ones that did escape are being persued and tracked. That means that everything that you have done was for nothing. The Break Out had failed. After you got caught, the whole entire plan fell apart. Then, a guard approaches you, and askes what you want to eat. The guard says that you can get anything that you want. You ask for a nice steak with some wine, and the guard agrees. Shortly after, you are given your steak and wine, and then begin to dine. After you are done your meal, you remember something. You remember something that you watched on YouTube when you were a kid. Then your realized that the meal that was given to you, was your last meal.
