<p style="color:white">You start running away from the head guard and call for backup, and people from your clan and the allies start coming to your aid. Some guards see that you guys are grouping together and running away, so they join the persuit. Seeing this, you decide that the best option that you can do is to try and slow down the guards, so they will get distracted giving you more time to make a better plan on how to stop the persuit. You tell the 2 people closet to you to start throwing things that they can find at the guards, while still running away. You also tell them to run in unpredictable patterns. The last thing that you told them is to pass the message on so that everyone knows what to do. Before you know it, everyone has scattered and the guards are having things being thrown at them, slowing them down as they now have to defend themselves. The people that came to your aid are throwing things like rocks, bottles, and various other small objects that they could find at the guards from many different angles. The other people in the clan and all of the remaining allies see that you guys are doing this, and they decide to join in . Suddenly, something unexpected happens. Recess starts, and everyone is let outside, where you guys are. Due to the fact that the guards are being distracted, everyone then creates chaos while trying to escape the prison. You realize that everyone is taking advantage of you, your clan, and your allies, so you tell everyone to run and try to escape. Before you start to run, everyone throws something heavy at the guards so then they could get a headstart while the guards are stunned. Soon enough, the whole entire prison becomes a battlefield, with people running and trying to escape everywhere. You then realize that this whole situation has become every clan/alliance for themselves, as prisoners are now fighting other prisoners that aren't in the same clan as them just so the they can escape. You know that, from this point, you either fight your way out, or try to sneak out, using the chaos as cover. What do you do?
