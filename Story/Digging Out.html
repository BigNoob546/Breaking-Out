<p style="color:white"> You have chosen that you are going to take a spoon and dig your way out of the prison, just like how they do it in the movies. You pick up the spoon and start trying to dig your way out, soon to realize that you aren't making that much progress this way. You think that maybe, just maybe, if you try for enough time you will eventually get out. You keep on trying and trying and...... A guard notices you.
