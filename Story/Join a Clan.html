<p style="color:white">You think that the best thing that you can do is to tell one of the clans what your ideas are, and then hope that they let you join. You think that this will be way faster. At recess, you start thinking of the clans that you can ask. Then it hits you. You obviously have to go for Clan Big, as they strike fear into everyone, even some of the guards. If you get them on your side, then there is nothing that anyone can do about you breaking out, and even joining forces with other clans that you know. You go over to Clan Big, and start telling them your ideas in secret. They seem impressed that you are want to escape, let alone made a whole plan. They listen to you, and it seems like things are going really good. When you are done explaining, Clan Big says that they are going to think about it. After recess is done, guards approach you. Clan Big had told the guards that you were planning on escaping! Using you as a distraction, they used a modified verison of your plan to escape themselves.</p>
