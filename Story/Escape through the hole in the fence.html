<h1 style="font-family:arial;color:navy;font-size:20px;">Escape Through the Hole in the fence</h1>

<p style="color:white">You look around, and see multiple ways to exit out of the prison. After a bit of thinking from that big brain of yours, and decide to escape through a hole that was made in the fence surrounding the sides and back of the building. You tell everyone in your clan and all your allies that you are going to escape using that pathway. Everyone thinks that you can be trusted as you have gotten this far without a single blunder, so they all come with you even though they have their doubts. You all stand close together, and you touch the fence so you can crawl out. Then, you realize something. The fence was an electic fence, and now you have been shocked by over 20 amps of power! To put that into perspective, around 100-200 milliamps (0.1-0.2 amp) is all it takes to kill someone. You were shocked by around 100 times that power. Worst of all, due to the fact that you, your clan, and your allies were all standing close to each other, you all got shocked as none of you were wearing anything made out of rubber. You, your clan, and your allies all stand there just being *litearlly* shocked for a few seconds, before all dropping to the ground.
