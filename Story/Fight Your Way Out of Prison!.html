<p style="color:white">You think about your options from this point. You can either have a massive rumble with many other clans, trying to win against many, and I mean many other clans. You decide that you want to go the hard way out. I mean, the guards are all defeated by the hands of your big brain, so what's the worst that can happen. Plus, you not only have just your clan, but you also have 4 other clans in your alliance, meaning that you easily outnumber anyone that wants to fight you. So, you think that you want to go out with a bang, and tell everyone that you want to fight our way out, as that would make for a better movie, as you know that people are eventualy going to make movies about what had happened on this day. So, you all put on your toughest look, and walk up to a random clan that you haven't really been paying attention too, and you start attacking them. They fight back, but just like you predicted, you easily outnumber them, so their efforts are put into vain. Or are they? While you are in the midst of this fight, something unexpected happens. A variable that you hadn't considered starts popping up and causing major errors in your plan. Other clans that love to fight, such as Clan Big, see the fight and decide that they want in, and they start fighting anyone that comes in their path, including you. Clans that hate Clan Big also get into the rumble, as they want to finally get their chance to take out Clan Big before they go. Many other people see this gaint rumble going on, and just join in. You hadn't considered that they are in jail for a reason. They are criminals. This is something that they consider fun. Soon, everyone in the rumble looses track of everyone that they are friends, clan-mates, or even allies with, and it becomes a free-for-all brawl. As soon as this starts, you are caught up in the crossfire, and most of the people in your clan and allies don't view you as "on the same team." You were able to gather the ones that want to get out of this mess with you, and you try and leave the rumble. Big Mistake. People from Clan Big see you guys, and start targeting you, as they think that you are weak for trying to run away. Soon enough, you and everyone that you were able to gather are now beaten, some of them in coma's, others passed out, and the lucky ones, you being a part of that group, just beat up real bad. You can't move due to all the pain, and you are pretty sure that you have some broken bones. Then, for some reason, a stampede happens, and you are stomped on by around 100 people. Then, you feel yourself fading.
