<p style="color:white">Well, you came to the conclusion that it is best to wait it out and get more information about the clans. Specifically which ones are open to get new people in the clan, and which ones want to escape from the prison. You observe and take note of the different clans for about 2 weeks, then you found the perfect clan. They are Clan Small. This clan is open to let anyone join, they are reliable, and they really want to get out of prison, just like you. This is a perfect fit. You join the clan and tell them your ideas, to which they think are amazing and have a low chance of failing. They let you into the clan, and you start discussing what you can do in certain situations, which day you should do it, etc. After gathering data, you see that the best day of escaping in Wednesday of that week, due to the fact that for some reason most of the guards aren't going to be there, and the ones that are going to be there are the known for being unatentive and veyr lenient. You then get more data on which clans are also willing to do the same, and you make some alliances which would make it harder for the guards to stop all of you. Wednesday comes, and you put your plan into action. Everything is ging according to plan except: 1 guard. You know this guard, as they are very popular. They are the head guard, which is known for being very brutal and unmerciful. Somehow, you and every clan that is working with you and Clan Small didn't see this coming. At this moment in time, you are alone. The head guard then notices you. What do you do?
