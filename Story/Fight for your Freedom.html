<h1 style="font-family:arial;color:navy;font-size:20px;">Fight the Head Guard for your Freedom!</h1>

<p style="color:white">You noticed the head guard, and he notices you. The head guard's attention immediately snaps onto you. In the midst of your panic, you think that the only way that you can get out of this is by fighting the guard for your freedom. You think that if you fight the guard, even if you lose the fight, at least everyone else can get far enough, so then they can find their own ways to get out. You also know that you are the center of the plan, meaning that if you are defeated then that means that the plan has failed. Once again, even if this plan fails, everyone will be so far away that they will have lots of time to think about other ways to get out, so then they can have their freedom. Due to fact that you think that nothing can go wrong, you fight the head guard. The head guard notices that you are there for a fight, and he deciedes to have some fun and fight you. You guys start to fight, and some of the other guards notice, but they don't interfere. You thought that it was a bit weird that they aren't trying to get you to stop fighting, but you don't think that much of it since you are in a fight. You think that you are starting to win the fight, but that's when the worst happens. The head guard played a bit with your mind. He made you think that you are winning, which makes you think that you don't have to use that much power. Then, he whips out a ton of power, and knocks you out with 1 punch! When you start to regain consciousness, you see that most if not all of the people in your clan and allies are being dragged to the sps with you, and they don't look good. Apparently, instead of breaking up the fight, the other guards thought that fighting the ones that were running away was a good idea. You then lose conciousness again. When you finally fully regain your consciousness, you realize that you are in the sps. After a few hours, a guard comes to your cell, and asks you what you want to eat. You tell him that you aren't hungry, and the guard just says "okay" and leaves you alone. You are
confused on why the guards are being so nice to you, but then you start realizing something. That was supposed to be your last meal before death row.
