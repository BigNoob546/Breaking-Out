<p style="color:white">You are a prisoner at the Secure Prison of Solutiude (sps for short). You did some really bad things to get in here, but have learned you lesson. Even though you have learned you lesson, the guards don't believe you. You really want to get out, as you know that they do terrible things to the prisoners that live here. You start to think of busting out of here. What do you do?
