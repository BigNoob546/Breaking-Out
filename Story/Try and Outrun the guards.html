<p style="color:white"> You start running and calling for backup, and backup does come. Other guards start joining the persuit. You start to panic again, as the guards start to outnumber you and your backup. You know that one wrong decision and you are done for. While running and panicking, you think that the most that you can do is just keep on running, and hope that you will eventually outrun the guards. The guards notice that all you are doing is running, and they draw their guns. You look back to see some guards holding their guns, and then realize that you made a mistake. By just trying to outrun the guards, you have made a mistake that you wanted to avoid. Because you were just running away from the guards, they could predict where you were going to go, and therefore they could fire at you. By the time that you realize this, it's too late. The guards had already shot down half the backup. In a desperate attempt to try and get away, you tell everyone to scatter. Everyone listens, but the guards are still firing at you guys. Right as you try to scatter, you are shot in the foot by one of the guards. You fall down, and look around helplessly. After the guards stop firing, you take one last look around. Of the 15 people that had a chance to scatter and run away, only 1/3 of the people were able to escape. Of the 10 people that couldn't escape, 1/2 of them died after falling down. You and the other 4 people that were still alive were brough back into the sps. You each got your own cell, which was pretty good. Later that week, a guard came up to your and asked what you wanted to eat. You realized that this was going to be your last meal, as after you are done eating you are going to be sent to death row.
