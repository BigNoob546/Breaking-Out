<p style="color:white"> You decide that, to prove that you have learned your lesson, instead of doing something crazy, you should be calm about the whole thing and just talk to the guards. You say that you have to say something, and for some reason the guards at sps listen to you. You say that you have learned your lesson, and the guards don't believe you. What do you do from here?
