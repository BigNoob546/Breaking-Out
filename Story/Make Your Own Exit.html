<p style="color:white">You look around, and you see multiple ways that you can escape. You think about the best way that you can escape. You think for a while, as you can't figure out the best route out. Finally, you come to a conclusion. You decide that the best way to get out, is to do it yourself! You see that there is a giant truck that you can use to drive through the wall, in the process letting everyone that isn't already dead escape. The reaons that you didn't take any of the other options> Well it's a prison, and everyone is there for a reason. Firstly, the fence is meant to keep prisoners in for a reason, meaning that there has to be some sort of catch, which you don't want to risk. If you try and get though the front door then you might get caught between the fight, which is also not something that you want. And finally, the path that other prisoners made may be a trap, considering that, well, it's a prisoner. They probably are going something sketchy, which means that you are not safe going through there. So, the only option left is to make your own exit. Luckily, one of the reasons why you ended up in this prison is because you broke into someone's car during a persuit with the police. You tell everyone that they are finally going to be free, and tell them to get into the truck of the truck. You then break into the truck and used a handy trick that you learned to start the engine. Then, you start accelerating. You go pedal-to-the-metal and break right
through the front door! In the proccess, some ignorant prisoners did get run over but you don't care, since they should have heard the engine is moved. That's their problem. After driving the truck away from the broken all, you stop the truck, tell everyone to get out, then destroy the engine so no one can use the truck. You are finally free, after all this hard work. It took a lot of physical strength, courage, and also mental strength to complete the mission, but it is finally done. You then walk out into the real world, and think of what you are going to do. Before you left, you took some things that you know would sell for a lot of the black market, and sure enough they do. You then rent an apartment under a fake ID, so then you now have a place to live. Using that fake ID you get a job, and start making some money. You think that there may be a shot at a semi-normal life now.
