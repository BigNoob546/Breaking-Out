<p style="color:white">You are in your cell, talking to the guard. The guard doesn't believe you, and you quickly have to think up of something to say, just so that the guard will give you a chance. Due to this thinking, you say that you have learned your lesson, and that if the guard gives you a chance to prove it, then you can. Hearing this, the guard get's interested. He turns a lot of his attention you, mainly because you sounded like you were begging. Then the guard says: "Fine. You get this one chance. If you can't prove that you are innocent right this second then I am not going to listen to anything that you say that is along the line of 'I have learned my lesson.' You time starts now." There is a problem though. You don't know what to do, since that was just the first thing that came to your mind. You didn't actually have a plan (silly you). The guard waits for around 30 seconds, in which you can't think of anything. Then the gaurd says "I guess that I was right to not listen to you." and turns away. What do you do?
