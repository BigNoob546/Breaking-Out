<h1 style="font-family:arial;color:navy;font-size:20px;">Escape Using the Path that Other Prisoners Made</h1>

<p style="color:white">You look around, and see all the ways that you can escape. You have a few options, and you are having a hard time choosing. Finally, you decide that you want to take a gamble, and you tell everyone in your clan and allies to go through the path that other prisoners made. The reasoning? You think that if so many others are going through there, then it must work. You all rush towards the path, which was really just a peice of the fence that was destroyed. You are all ready to get out, but then your brain and good reflexes come in handy. You see that below you, there is no ground. You would just fall to your death. You tell everyone to wait up, and you show them the death-drop. You all agree that you guys need to find a different way to get out, so your turn around and........ BAM Suddenly, you and everyone in your clan and allies have been hit in the head, with some of the people who were close to you knocked off the building, and left falling to their death. You wanted to get back up, but you couldn't. They hit your head, and you, and everyone else, were stunned. Suddenly, your felt a sharp pain. Something had hit you. Then, you felt something else moving you. You were moving closer and closer to the edge by the secound, and you coudln't do anything about it. You were in too much pain to stop it. Then, you reached the end. And you started falling. And you saw other black object fall with you. And then loud crack, before you felt yourself quickly fading.
