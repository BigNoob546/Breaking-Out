<p style="color:white">You notice the head guard, and the head guard notices you. In the midst of you panic, you think that there is no way that you can win in a fight. Due to this, you find that there are 2 other options. You can run, or you can get backup from your clan and allies. But, you find a flaw with both options. When you are running you can get shot, and when you ask for backup, you can get outnumbered by the guards in the nearby area. But, you then realize that you can do both. You can run and call for backup, and therefore you are eliminating the main problems with doing one or the other! You start running as fast as you can, as you know that your life depends on it. While you are running, you call for backup. Your clan and some allies see that you are desperately dashsing away, and they hear that you need backup. Many people come to your aid and run with you. Some guards see what is happening, and they join the persuit. What should you do?
